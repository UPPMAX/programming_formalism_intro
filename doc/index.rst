Introduction day to Programming formalism
=========================================

.. admonition:: This course
   
   - This course aims to give life scientists, bioinformaticians, and other scientists with some experience in programming and scripting an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. 
   - The course aims to strengthen the understanding of:
      - more advanced programming concepts
      - ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming and to 
      - enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.

   - We will cover an introduction to 
   
      - Algorithms and Data structures
      - Programming Paradigms especially structured
      - object oriented programming 
    
    - We will give a overview of other paradigms like functional programming. Modular development and (code) reusability, testing and optimisation.

   - The modules will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.
