Introduction day to Programming formalism
=========================================

.. admonition:: This course
   
   - This course aims to give life scientists, bioinformaticians, and other scientists with some experience in programming and scripting an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. 
   - The course aims to strengthen the understanding of:
      - more advanced programming concepts
      - ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming and to 
      - enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.



.. admonition:: Content

   - We will cover an introduction to 
   
      - Algorithms and Data structures
      - Programming Paradigms
            - especially structured
            - functional programming
            - modular development
            - code reusability
            - testing
            - optimisation.
      - object oriented programming 
    
   - The modules will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.

.. prereq::

   -  A reasonably recent version of **Git is installed**
   -  **Git should be configured prior to the course**
   -  A `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ user account (but alternatives
      exist, see below).
   -  Being comfortable with the command line. 
   -  Students should be familiar with using a **text editor** on their
      system. Emacs and Vim are excellent choices if you know how to use
      them but Nano or Notepad on Windows are sufficient.
