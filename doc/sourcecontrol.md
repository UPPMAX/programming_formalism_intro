Keypoints



    Initializing a Git repository is simple: git init.

    Commits should be used to tell a story.

    Git uses the .git folder to store the snapshots.

    Don’t be afraid to stage and commit often. Better too often than not often enough.


    A branch is a division unit of work, to be merged with other units of work.

    A tag is a pointer to a moment in the history of a project.


    A repository can have one or multiple remotes (we will revisit these later).

    Local branches often track remote branches.

    A remote serves as a full backup of your work.

    We’ll properly learn how to use these in the Collaborative Git lesson.
