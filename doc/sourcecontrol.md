## Working remotely and sharing (github)

### Create repository - code along
Create a remote repository

    Log in to your GitHub account and press the New button on the left:
        Make sure you are listed as the owner
        Add a repository name, e.g. git_tutorial
        You can keep the repo private or make it public, as you wish
        Skip including a README, a .gitignore and licence



```{Keypoints}
- Initializing a Git repository is simple: git init.
- Commits should be used to tell a story.
- Git uses the .git folder to store the snapshots.
- Donâ€™t be afraid to stage and commit often. Better too often than not often enough.
- A branch is a division unit of work, to be merged with other units of work.
- A tag is a pointer to a moment in the history of a project.
- A repository can have one or multiple remotes (we will revisit these later).
- Local branches often track remote branches.
- A remote serves as a full backup of your work.
