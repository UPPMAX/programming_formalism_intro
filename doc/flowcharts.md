# Unified Modeling language
- UML is not a programming language. It's a graphical notation for drawing diagrams to visualize object oriented systems.
-  UML includes over a dozen different types of structural and behavioral diagrams. 

- caveats 
  - UML has been marketed for many contexts.[24][31]
  - It has been treated, at times, as a design silver bullet, which leads to problems. 
  - UML misuse includes overuse (designing every part of the system with it, which is unnecessary) and assuming that novices can design with it.[32]
  - It is considered a large language, with many constructs. Some people (including Jacobson) feel that UML's size hinders learning (and therefore, using) it

class diagrams and use case diagrams 

 "These diagrams should be a quick, useful communication tool. A support system for your brain, not the other way around!"
