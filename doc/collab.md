rent types of remotes:
- If you have a server you can ssh to, you can use that as a remote.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular, closed-source commercial site.
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) is a popular, open-core
  commercial site.  Many universities have their own private GitLab servers
  set up.
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) is yet another popular commercial site.
- Another option is [NotABug](https://notabug.org)

## Github
There are two more ways to create “copies” of repositories into your user space:

    A repository can be marked as template and new repositories can be generated from it, like using a cookie-cutter. The newly created repository will start with a new history, only one commit, and not inherit the history of the template.
