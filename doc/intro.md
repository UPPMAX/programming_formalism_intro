# Introduction

```{questions}
- What is the Purpose of Formalism in Computer Science?
- What is software development life cycle
- There seem to be many concepts in this course. What do they mean?


```

```{objectives}
- We'll give an introducton to the week
- We'll give some introduction to concepts used in the course
- We'll give some introduction to tools
- We'll try to set up the mindset to find the rest of the week interesting and useful!
```

```{instructor-note}
- Lecture 15 min
- Discussions 10 min
```

## What is software?

### Some concepts
- program
- script
- tool
- model

## What is software development?

- Different types of Scientific software:
  - analysis of data
    - statistics
    - figures
    - visualization
  - tools for process data
    - refining data (formatting)
    - bioinformatics
  - workflows
  - modelling (mimic the reality)
      - simulations time-varying bahvour of a system
      - mathematical models of relationships among variables in a system 
  - decision assistance

### Icebreaker

What experience have you had?



## Development cycle

agile = characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.

### Basic models
- waterfall
  1.	Requirements
  2.	Analysis and design
  3.	Development
  4.	Test
  5.	Development and maintenance

- Spiral model: iterating waterfalls, quadrants
  - Planning: reqs, identification: analysis
  -	Risk analysis: build prototypes to identify risks
  -	Engineering: software implementation
  -	Evaluation: stakeholder review, feedback, plan next iteration
  -	Each lab is new cycle: prototype --> RC --> Launch
  -	Risk driven

More about life cycles in next session and Day 3
